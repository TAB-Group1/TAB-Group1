Weâ€™m @TAB-Group1ðŸ‘‹, a Genetics Degree students group made by D. Anton, Ãˆ. Badosa, V. FernÃ¡ndez & last, but not less important, E. Garcia. We are coursing Current Topics on Bioinformatics, a 3ECTS optative subject of the 4th course of the degree.
We are so interested in Bioinformatics ðŸ‘€ and it's different branches, from igh-throughput computing to statistical and visual analysis. Our profiles are a little bit different: 
- Dani Anton ðŸ“« is an ex-biotechnology student that changed his mind and started studing Genetics, deveoping his abbilities in Informatics from the first course, when he created a program using the prisoneer's dilema and appling it to an evolution model. Now, he is doing his internship with Isaac Salazar in mathematical developmental models.
- Ãˆlia Badosa ðŸŒ± is a transversal profile, so she is interested in wet and dry laboratory. She is coursing this subject in order to earn skills that could be useful in her future, because she is aware about the importance of the bionformatics.
- VÃ­ctor FernÃ¡ndez âš¡ is a we-lab hater & bioinformatics lover. He has done his internship in CRAG (Center for Research in Agicultural Genomics) in pig's Structural Variants detection with short-read sequencing data. He is currently doing another internship to conitnue with the project.
- Eric Garcia ðŸ˜„ is also a great bionformatics enjoyer who also did a short internship in CRAG, where he worked analyzing goat populations. Now, he is in IBB (Biomedicine and Bioinformatics Insititute) coursing and internship to analyze inversions and detect other variants inside of them.
We are sure that we are going to learn a lot with TAB and we are going to perform practical work that will be crucial for our future careers.
